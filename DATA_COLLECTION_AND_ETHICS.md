Statement of Data Collection and Ethical Intent

This project, “Living in the Feed: How Social Media Content Shapes the Adolescent Mind,” is conducted under Reykjavík University’s Cybersecurity Defense program (Autumn 2025). The research examines algorithmic sentiment bias across geopolitical contexts through controlled persona mirroring, comparing how social-media algorithms deliver emotionally distinct content to identical user profiles in different regions.

All data collection will be strictly limited to publicly available content on social-media platforms. No private profiles, login-restricted material, or user interactions (likes, comments, messages, or follows) will be accessed or performed. Data will consist solely of publicly visible text such as captions, hashtags, and engagement metrics, gathered for the purpose of sentiment analysis using models such as VADER.

Residential proxies are employed solely to simulate regional access and ensure the authenticity of location-based algorithmic exposure. All collection and storage follow university ethical-research standards, GDPR principles, and a data-minimisation approach—ensuring no personally identifiable information is retained.

This work is purely academic, non-commercial, and aims to advance understanding of how algorithmic content distribution influences emotional tone and user experience across cultures.
